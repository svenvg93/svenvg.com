Setting up a MikroTik router for your homelab can be an exciting way to improve network performance, security, and management. MikroTik routers are known for their flexibility, power, and affordability, making them an ideal choice for homelab enthusiasts looking to build a robust network infrastructure. In this post, we‚Äôll walk you through the essential steps to get your MikroTik router up and running.

## Connect to the router

To configure the MikroTik router, you‚Äôll first need to establish a connection. We recommend using either a serial cable or an SSH connection. These methods allow you to easily copy and paste the configuration commands provided below, making the setup process more efficient and error-free.

### Using a Serial Cable

1. Connect the serial cable to the MikroTik router and your computer.
2. Use terminal software like PuTTY (Windows), screen (Linux), or Serial (macOS).
3. Configure the terminal software with the following settings:
  - **Baud Rate** : 115200
  - **Data Bits** : 8
  - **Stop Bits** : 1
  - **Parity** : None
  - **Flow Control** : None
4. Open the connection, and you‚Äôll see the MikroTik console.
5. When prompted, enter the default username `admin` and leave the password field blank (default).

### Using SSH
1. Connect your computer to one of the LAN ports of the MikroTik router using an Ethernet cable.
2. Ensure your computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically (DHCP). The router will assign your computer an IP address.
3. Find the default IP address of the MikroTik router (usually 192.168.88.1) and use SSH to connect.
4. When prompted, enter the default username `admin` and leave the password field blank (default).

First, we‚Äôll configure the LAN ports to establish a network connection for all your devices. This will ensure that both your homelab and internet access are set up properly, providing seamless connectivity throughout your network.

## LAN

### Bridge Interface

we‚Äôll create a bridge interface, allowing us to combine all the ports into a single network. This will enable seamless communication between all your devices on the same network.

```bash
/interface bridge
add name=bridge1 protocol-mode=none
/interface bridge port
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether2
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether3
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether4
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether5
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether6
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether7
add bridge=bridge1 interface=ether8
/interface list
add name=LAN
/interface list member
add interface=bridge1 list=LAN
/ip address
add address=192.168.1.1/24 interface=bridge1 network=192.168.1.0
```

### DHCP

Now, we‚Äôll set up a DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses to all the devices connected to your network.

```bash
/ip dhcp-server network
add address=192.168.1.0/24 dns-server=192.168.1.1 gateway=192.168.1.1 netmask=24
/ip pool
add name=dhcp_pool0 ranges=192.168.1.100-192.168.1.254
/ip dhcp-server
add address-pool=dhcp_pool0 interface=bridge1 lease-time=1d name=dhcp1
```

### DNS

Next, we‚Äôll enable DNS queries on the router and configure it to forward those queries to the upstream DNS server. This will ensure that your devices can resolve domain names and access websites without any issues.

```bash
/ip dns
set allow-remote-requests=yes
```

## Firewall

The firewall will be configured to block all incoming traffic by default, only allowing connections that are established, related, or untracked. Outgoing traffic will be permitted solely from the LAN side, ensuring secure and controlled communication between your devices and the internet.

```bash
/ip firewall filter
add action=accept chain=forward comment="Allow established,related,untracked" connection-state=established,related,untracked
add action=drop chain=forward comment="drop invalid traffic" connection-state=invalid
add action=accept chain=forward comment="port forwarding" connection-nat-state=dstnat
add action=accept chain=forward comment="internet traffic" in-interface-list=LAN out-interface-list=WAN
add action=drop chain=forward comment="drop all else"
add action=accept chain=input comment="Allow established,related,untracked" connection-state=established,related,untracked
add action=drop chain=input comment="Drop invalid" connection-state=invalid
add action=accept chain=input comment="Allow traffic from LAN interface list to the router" in-interface-list=LAN
add action=drop chain=input comment="Drop all else"
/ip firewall service-port
set ftp disabled=yes
set tftp disabled=yes
set h323 disabled=yes
set sip disabled=yes
```

## WAN

We‚Äôll need to configure the WAN interface to obtain an IP address from your ISP. In this setup, the physical interface `ether1` will be used to connect to your ISP. Make sure to replace all the placeholders between `<>` with the correct information provided by your ISP.

#### DHCP with VLAN
```bash
/interface vlan add interface=ether1 name=internet vlan-id=<ISP VLAN ID> 
/ip dhcp-client add interface=internet disabled=no use-peer-ntp=no add-default-route=yes 
/interface list add name=WAN 
/interface list member add interface=internet list=WAN
```
{: file="DHCP with VLAN" }

#### DHCP
```bash
/interface ethernet set ether1 name=internet 
/ip dhcp-client add interface=internet add-default-route=yes disabled=no use-peer-ntp=no 
/interface list add name=WAN 
/interface list member add interface=internet list=WAN`
```
{: file="DHCP" }

#### PPPoE with VLAN
```bash
/interface add interface=ether1 name=vlan_int vlan-id=<ISP VLAN ID> 
/interface pppoe-client add add-default-route=yes disabled=no interface=vlan_int name=internet use-peer-dns=yes user=<username> password=<password>
/interface list add name=WAN 
/interface list member add interface=internet list=WAN`
```
{: file="PPPoE with VLAN" }

#### PPPoE
```bash
/interface pppoe-client add add-default-route=yes disabled=no interface=ether1 name=internet use-peer-dns=yes user=<username> password=<password> 
/interface list add name=WAN 
/interface list member add interface=internet list=WAN`
```
{: file="PPPoE" }

#### Static IP
```bash
/interface ethernet set ether1 name=internet 
/ip address add address=<IP Address> interface=internet 
/ip route add gateway=<IP Gateway> 
/ip dns set servers=<DNS Server> 
/interface list add name=WAN 
/interface list member add interface=internet list=WAN`
```
{: file="Static IP" }


## NAT

We‚Äôll now set up a NAT rule to translate all outgoing traffic from your local network to your public IP address. This will enable devices in your homelab to access the internet using the router‚Äôs public IP, ensuring proper routing and security for all outgoing connections.

```bash
/ip firewall nat
add action=masquerade chain=srcnat comment="Enable NAT on WAN interface" out-interface-list=WAN
```

## System

We‚Äôll create a new user account with the necessary privileges and then disable the default user account. This will help prevent unauthorized access and ensure that only trusted users can manage the router. As well we you can change the hostname for the router.

### User Account

```bash
/user add name=<Username> password=<Password> group=full
/user disable admin
```

> * Replace `<Username>` to your new username
> * Replace `<Password>` to your new password

### Hostname

```bash
/system identity
set name=<Your hostname>
```

### NTP

To ensure the router displays the accurate time, we‚Äôll configure the correct timezone.

```bash
/system ntp client
set enabled=yes
/system ntp client servers
add address=time.cloudflare.com
/system clock
set time-zone-name=<Your Timezone>
```
> Replace `<Your Timezone>` this to your timezone

Now your MikroTik router is fully configured and ready to power your homelab! üéâ With a secure and efficient network in place, you can focus on building and exploring your homelab projects. Happy networking! ü§ù
